    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Courgette fries are fried courgettes. This recipe is based on the BBC Good Food recipe.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp plain flour</li>
        <li>2 courgettes</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>15g parmesan</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Tip the flour into a bowl, drizzle in 2 tbsp water and mix to form a thick batter. Season with plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper, then mix in the courgettes.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a pan until it is about 4cm deep, ensuring the pan is no more than two thirds full. Set over a medium heat until 180C or a flick of batter dropped in sizzles and turns brown within 30 seconds. Lower half the battered courgettes into the hot oil and fry, turning after 1 min using a slotted spoon, for 5-6 mins until golden. If they begin to stick together, gently coax them apart with tongs. Remove from the hot oil and drain on a plate lined with a sheet of kitchen paper. Repeat with the remaining half, then scatter with the parmesan before serving.</li>
